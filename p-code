import cv2

# Read the image
img = cv2.imread('grape.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply any necessary preprocessing steps here (e.g., smoothing, thresholding).

# Apply grape detection algorithm - this part needs to be implemented based on your specific algorithm.
# For example, you could use techniques like contour detection, color thresholding, or machine learning-based approaches

# Display or save the final image - this part needs to be implemented based on your specific requirement
# For example, you could use cv2.imshow() to display the image or cv2.imwrite() to save it

# Example code for displaying the image
# cv2.imshow('Grape Detection', img)
# cv2.waitKey(0)
# cv2.destroyAllWindows()
